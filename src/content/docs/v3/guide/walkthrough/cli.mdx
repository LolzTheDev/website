Setting up the [CLI](https://github.com/sern-handler/cli) is easy.

The CLI is your plug to the sern ecosystem. It allows you to install plugins with ease, install extra utilities, and much more.

## Installing the CLI

If you haven't already installed the CLI globally, you can do so by running:

import PackageManagers from '~/components/PackageManagers.astro';

<PackageManagers command="add" text="-g @sern/cli"/>

## Adding Plugins

:::caution
You must have a [sern.config.json](/v3/guide/walkthrough/good-to-know#sernconfigjson) to use this command.
:::

To install [plugins](/v3/guide/walkthrough/plugins) maintained by the community [repository](https://github.com/sern-handler/awesome-plugins):

```sh
sern plugins
```

This will display a menu selection of all installable plugins.

If you'd like to view all plugins, check out our [plugins page](/plugins).

## Extra Utilities

To install extra utilities into your project, run:

```sh
sern extra
```

We have a more in depth [guide](/v3/cli/about) on the CLI if you're interested in learning more.
