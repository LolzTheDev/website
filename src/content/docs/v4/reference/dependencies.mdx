Manage objects which contain lots of state. If you were a previous user of Sapphire, dependency injection is the moral equivalent of `container`.
Dependency injection promotes maintainability and helps organize imports. 

For example, a minimal setup for any project might look like this:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- src/
    - index.js **(your main file and client)**
    - **dependencies.d.ts** **(for intellisense)**
</FileTree>



```js title="src/index.js"
const client = new Client({
  ...options,
});

await makeDependencies((root) => {
    root.add("@sern/client", client),
});
```

Everything else is handled. However, you may want customize things.

## Adding Dependencies to Root

When [makeDependencies](/v4/api/functions/makedependencies) is called, sern **implicility** adds dependencies to the container. A few of these are shown: 
- `@sern/logger`:  Loggers implement [`Logging`](/v4/api/interfaces/logging)
- `@sern/modules`: A map of all command modules. ID -> Module
- `@sern/errors`:  Handling errors and lifetime â†’ [`ErrorHandling`](/v4/api/interfaces/errorhandling)
- `@sern/emitter`: Emit events that occur throughout the lifecycle of a project â†’ [`Emitter`](/v3/api/interfaces/emitter)

:::tip
Swap out these dependencies **at your own risk**.
A common occurence in sern projects is to swap out the Logger for a custom one. An example:
```ts {2}
await makeDependencies(({ swap }) => {
    //MAKE SURE `MyCustomLogger` implements Logging
    swap('@sern/logger', new MyCustomLogger());
})
```

## Lifecycle Hooks
Dependencies can call a function throughout you bot's lifetime.

### Init

> Your object needs to initiate things. Developers are allowed to use `async` and `await`.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Do you need to perform intializing behavior for a dependency?
    ```js title="src/database.js"
    import pg from 'pg'
    const { Client } = pg
    class Database {
        __database = new Client()
        async init() {
            await this.__database.connect();
        }
    }
    ```

2. Modify your `Dependencies` interface:
    ```js title="src/dependencies.d.ts" {4}
    import { Database } from './services/database.js'
    interface Dependencies extends CoreDependencies {
        database: Database;
    }
    ```

3. Make sure its been added:
    ```ts title="src/index.ts" {3}
    await makeDependencies(({ add }) => {
        add('database', new Database())
    })
    ```

4. Now, when your bot starts, the `init` method will be called. ðŸŽ‰

</Steps>

### Dispose 
> Your object needs to destroy things before shutdown, if a crash occurs


<Steps>
1. Do you need to perform intializing behavior for a dependency?
    ```js title="src/database.js"
    import pg from 'pg'
    const { Client } = pg
    class Database {
        __database = new Client()
        async init() {
            await this.__database.connect();
        }
        async dispose() {
            console.log("Disposing database")
        }
    }
    ```

3. Make sure its been added:
    ```js title="src/index.ts" {3}
    await makeDependencies(({ add }) => {
        add('database', new Database())
    })
    ```
4. Now, when your bot starts, the `dispose` method will be called. ðŸŽ‰
</Steps>

:::tip
Both `dispose` and `init` are exposed as interfaces in TypeScript. For extra typesafety it may be feasible to implement these interfaces.
```ts
import { type Init } from '@sern/handler'
import pg from 'pg'
const { Client } = pg
class Database implements Init {
    __database = new Client()
    async init() {
        await this.__database.connect();
    }
}
```

## Usage in Commands
> This is for command modules, plugins only. event modules would have to use the `Service` api

Your dependencies are located in SDT.
```ts
export default commandModule({ 
    type: CommandType.Slash,
    execute: (ctx, sdt) =>{
       sdt.deps.database // Database
    }
})
```

## Service
The Service api is used for places where sern cannot inject into parameters properly. [View](/v3/guide/walkthrough/services/)


## When to use Dependency injection

Leveraging dependency injection in your projects is recommended because DI creates a loose coupling between the parts of your application.
As a result, the codebase is more modular and easier to test and refactor

:::danger 
Be careful and not take the idea of dependency injection to its extreme. For example:

Do not inject helper libraries like `lodash` as a dependency of your class. Import and use it directly.
Your codebase might not need loose coupling for components that are ever likely to get swapped or replaced.
For example, you may prefer importing the logger service vs. injecting the Logger class as a dependency.
