# What is sern?

We're a discord bot framework. The lack of tooling in the discord.js community is apparent, and is also monolithic. You can make botseasily with our suite of tools, and with conciseness. We're also a community. PLS join [here](https://sern.dev/discord) ðŸ˜¼. 

### Problem 

- **no beginner friendly handler**
- **bad practices in discord.js guide**
- **lack of wholesome community in discord.js**
- **lack of modularity**

sern tries to solve all these problems. This tutorial is for anyone and everyone, beginners and advanced a like.

## Solution 

- our handlers are modular and efficient.
- from my personal experience, the community feels pretentious and mean.
- discord.js discord chat feels pretentious and unwelcome to beginners.
- From community plugins to container, swap out tooling and things with ease.
