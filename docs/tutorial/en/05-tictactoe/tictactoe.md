> How hard can this be?

This will probably be the longest chapter in the guide. Don't worry though, once we're done, making commands is [**fodder**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fodder).

Here are some inspirational quotes to make you get motivated.
> "If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems." ― Frank Wilczek

> "Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them."  ― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 

> "Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present." ― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
