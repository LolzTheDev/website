# serendipity {#seren}
Hi. 
I believe in making complicated things simpler and am an OSS contributor. OSS for life. This handler has been my baby for a long time now.  
My favorite programming language is clojure 

# EvolutionX {#evo}
=======
You can call me Evo, I'm the automation lover of the team. discord.js was my turning point into programming and I've been hooked ever since. I'm a full stack developer and I love to learn new things. I'm also a huge fan of open source and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.
sern is close to my heart and I'm proud to be a part of it. Let's make some awesome bots together!

# Sr Izan {#ethan}

Hey! I'm Ethan, the only guy on the development team who is european, and the only one who commits on all repos except for the handler.

Nice to meet you and I hope you enjoy this guide as much as we enjoyed making it!

# ropox {#ropox}
Hey there, I'm ropox! ðŸ‘‹

I'm not just a programmer; I'm one of the passionate maintainers of the sern framework. My mission is to demystify Discord bot development and ensure it's accessible to everyone. But that's not all â€“ I wear multiple hats, including design (i designed the logo) and infrastructure 

some say [I'm the coolest of all](/blog/newlogo#ropox-thing)
