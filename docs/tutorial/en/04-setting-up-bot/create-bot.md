Creating a bot with sern is a piece of cake, trust me!
As discussed in [the npm create command chapter](../setting-up-project/npm-create), we're going to be using that awesome tool to set sern up.  
So, what are we waiting for? Let's get started!

Open up a terminal in your ~~failed~~ projects directory. Then, type the following command:
```sh
npm create @sern/bot
```
After installing the package, prompts will show up on your terminal. Neat!

## Prompt walkthrough

First, choose a template. In this guide, select the please select the `Javascript with sern cli & ESM` option when prompted.

Then, choose a project name. This one should be lowercase with dashes and/or underscores (aka `kebab-case` or `snake_case`).

In the package manager prompt, select [NPM](../preparing/package-manager)


And you're done... with that. See you in the next chapter, where you'll get your discord bot token!
