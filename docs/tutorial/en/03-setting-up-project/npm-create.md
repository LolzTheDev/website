Alright, you've got everything set up. Now it's time to create your bot!

## The backstory

In the initial days of sern, we used to create our bots with the `sern init` command in the CLI.  
This command was an easy way to set up a sern project in ten, even five minutes!

But now there's a new, cooler and faster sheriff in town: the [`npm create @sern/bot`](https://github.com/sern-handler/create-bot) command.
This was an alternative to the old command, which got deprecated in favor of this tool in no time.

## The GUI

Currently WIP by me, sern GUI will be a graphical frontend to sern CLI and the npm create command.
Follow development on the [Github repo](https://github.com/sern-handler/gui).

See you on the next chapter where we'll use the already discussed command to set up your bot!
