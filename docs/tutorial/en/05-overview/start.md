# start

## initiate
We start at the humble index.js. This is where this bot will start. Notice the Sern.init, hmm... I wonder what that does. (it initiates sern)
A few options are availible, which are conviently labeled already. Make sure to take a look at them.

## dependencies
This requires a little more explaning. Basically in `makeDependencies`, we initiate a container of services and structures. sern and you, the developer will use these structures. In the [template](../04-setting-up-bot/create-bot) you have now, we only initiate the client, which is necessary for the handler to run.
