A package manager is like a helper for your programs. It brings all the tools for your projects and makes sure they fit and work well together. It's like having someone organize things so you can work without problems.

Some examples are 
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) 
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) 
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

For this tutorial, we'll be using **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)**. It's made by Facebook.

**Advantages of Yarn:**
1. **Performance:** Yarn is fast enough and has efficient dependency management.
2. **Lockfile:** Yarn's `yarn.lock` file ensures deterministic builds, crucial for collaboration.
4. **Offline Mode:** Yarn offers a reliable offline mode, ideal for environments with limited internet access.
5. **Selective Installs:** You can choose to install specific packages without affecting the entire dependency tree.
6. **Plug-n-play:** Yarn 2 introduces "plug-n-play" (PnP), reducing disk space usage.

**Choice of Package Manager:**
For this tutorial, we will use Yarn as the package manager. Yarn offers several advantages like above and it's a great choice to streamline development and ensure consistency, especially in collaborative environments. Both npm and Yarn are excellent package managers, and your choice will depend on your specific project requirements and personal preferences. Regardless of which package manager you choose, make sure to document your choice and ensure that your team members are on the same page to avoid potential issues during development.
